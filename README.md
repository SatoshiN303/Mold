## Mold
*Mold gives super power to your Xcode with ready-to-use templates. Mold includes template for VIPER now. MVVM and MVP will be added soon.*

While using architecture like VIPER or MVP,it is tiresome to create files and establish connections. For example if you are following VIPER architecture, you will have to create atleast 5 files for one module. You also have to create connections between all these components using protocols. 

Mold will help you create these files and establish all the connections in a very few steps. Mold will be available as a template in your Xcode itself. 


## VIPER

VIPER is an application of Clean Architecture to iOS apps. The word VIPER is a backronym for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Routing. Clean Architecture divides an appâ€™s logical structure into distinct layers of responsibility. This makes it easier to isolate dependencies (e.g. your database) and to test the interactions at the boundaries between layers:
